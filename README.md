- First clone this repo
- Download pip and pipenv "pip3 install pipenv"
- Using pipenv, download django "pipenv install django"
- Access pipenv environment with "pipenv shell"
- To run the server, run "python manage.py runserver"
    - Note the server auto-updates as you write your code so you just need to refresh the web page

**if you run into a "'pipenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command" try adding "python -m" before pipenv. i.e. "python -m pipenv install django".**


**Ask me for any questions or difficulties, I recognize this is way more complex than it needs to be**
